# DS2002-Project1
This project uses a SQL server that is hosted on Microsoft Azure. To replicate it using a different SQL server, the sql files should be run first. They should be run in the following order: sakila-schema, sakila-data, Create_Dim_Date_and_Clean. The "mysql_arg" variable in the Project1.ipynb file would also need to be adjusted accordingly.
